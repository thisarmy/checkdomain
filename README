checkdomain
===========

See if a domain is set up correctly.

Checkdomain uses some heuristics to see if a domain is a "root" domain or a
"subdomain". Root in this case means a domain like mydomain.com and subdomain
means shop.mydomain.com. It is "www.-aware" too. That means it assumes that
you're checking a root domain like mydomain.com it will also check to see if
www.mydomain.com is pointing to the same place. It is smart enough not to do
this for subdomains.

When used from the command-line, checkdomain will print out the relevant
records, errors and warnings. If a domain does not resolve to a correct IP
address it will give you an error of some kind and warnings include using a
CNAME on a root domain (which is technically not allowed and causes all sorts
of problems when receiving email on that domain) or having the root domain and
www. subdomain pointing to different places.

Included are wrapper scripts for Tank and Ammo that double as examples.
